Product Goal: 
Build a tool that helps players plan out what they want to store in their stash based on the loadouts they want to use.
- Show items that recycle into needed items
- Show items that can be used to craft needed items

Non-goals:
- Don't display all info about every item. Focus info needed to plan stash for loadouts.
    - Ignore items not used in loadouts.
    - Ignore item details, focus on crafting, recycling, the item tree
- First version, focus on a single loadout. Second version, add all loadouts merge inputs
