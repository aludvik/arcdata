- The loot guide is a tool that helps users understand the relationships between items.
- The loot guide is displayed on the bottom of the app in a separate section that splits the
  screen horizontally. 
- The loot guide takes as input a selection of items that has been made by the user in the
  items spreadsheet.
- The loot guide is only displayed when the user has selected one or more items in the main
  spreadsheet part of the app.
- The loot guide can be minized by the user by clicking a button.
- The main feature of the loot guide is the crafting guide.
- The crafting guide displays a directed graph of all the items selected, all the items that
  can be used to craft the selected items, and all the items that can be used to craft the
  crafting items, and so on recursively until only non-craftable items are left.
- The crafting guide also shows, on the edge from item to item, the number of input items
  needed to craft the output item.
- In addition to the crafting guide, the loot guide can display similar graphs showing what
  the selected items can be salvaged into or recycled into.
